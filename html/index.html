<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org081ed0b">
<p>
See bottom for Email address of author. This article is completely a rookie for computers
and mobile phones. As long as you patiently follow the documentation down you can always
visit Google.
</p>

<p>
Due to some reasons, it is not possible to access and use well-known websites and
applications such as Google and Facebook in mainland China. This article does not intend
to discuss these reasons. My purpose is to enable people to use these services to
facilitate their work, study, life, and entertainment. Everything else has nothing to do
with me. Any problems that come with it are the responsibility of the individual.
</p>

<p>
For the sake of simplicity, I only discuss how to do it and achieve the desired effect,
not to talk about why. The structure discussed in this article is based on various systems
and hardware platforms. The main hardware platforms include mobile phones and
computers. There are Android and iOS operating systems in the mobile platform. The
computer platform is divided into three systems: Linux, Windows, and Mac. So next I will
follow these classifications to discuss how to achieve the access to Google and other
sites on these platforms.
</p>

<p>
It is getting harder and harder now to bypass. Now the common practice is to send your
access request to a server first, instead of sending it directly to a Google server. The
intermediate server will visit Google for you and return the result. Well, first of all,
you have to have your own intermediate server. Usually this intermediate server is
available in two ways. The first is to build your own server, and how to build your own
server is a tricky problem. Anyone who reads this document can ask the author how to do
this(see bottom). The other is to buy a server that has already been built by others. Here
I recommend a company that provides this kind of service: <a href="https://www.fyzhuji.com">https://www.fyzhuji.com</a>. And if
you decide to buy services provided by the company, I suggest you join the author's
self-built server instead of buying the company provided, so you not only save the trouble
of creating a server, but also avoid spending more to obtain the freedom of information
that you should get. If you think so, please contact the author. In short, I will assume
in this article that you already have a hypothetical server with the following
parameters(of course it doesn't work, you have to have its own available server).

<li><a id="org6c6dc0e"></a>Install<br>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6c6dc0e">
<p>
First we need to install the Android client. Obviously, these clients are hardly available
in mainland China. In my github I provided the software for download: <a href="https://github.com/Puqiyuan/Shadowsocks_Install/blob/master/Shadowsocks.apk">APK for
Android</a>. This is open source software, so you shouldnâ€™t worry about security issues such
as back doors.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org12ea777"></a>Configuration<br>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org12ea777">
<p>
Shadowsocks software runs after the installation is complete. It is probably as shown in
the initial run.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Picture of Shadowsocks initial run</p>
</div>

<p>
Then click the + symbol in the top right corner. After clicking it looks like this:
</p>

<div id="org63a513c" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/androidPhone2.jpg" alt="androidPhone2.jpg" width="250px">
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Picture of after click + symbol</p>
</div>

<p>
Then click "Manual Settings" in the top right corner. There are three ways to import the
server. Other methods can be tried after you are familiar with this software. After
clicking it looks like this:
</p>

<div id="orgce3f5d1" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/androidPhone3.jpg" alt="androidPhone3.jpg" width="250px">
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Picture of after click "Manual Setting"</p>
</div>

<p>
Of course, these parameters are not what we assumed <a href="#org335a1fa">here</a>. So we must modify it according
to the server parameters assumed <a href="#org335a1fa">here</a>. Parameters not mentioned in the screenshot do not
need to be modified. The figure after modifying the parameters is as follows.
</p>

<div id="org59dbea9" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/androidPhone4.jpg" alt="androidPhone4.jpg" width="250px">
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>Picture of after modified parameters</p>
</div>

<p>
Then click the small tick in the upper right corner to complete the parameter
configuration. Return to the main interface after completion.
</p>

<div id="orgb26079f" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/androidPhone5.jpg" alt="androidPhone5.jpg" width="250px">
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5: </span>Picture of completion of config</p>
</div>

<p>
Then click on the server entry 192.168.1.1. Makes it has a green bar on the left to
achieve the purpose of selecting this server. Like the figure:
</p>

<div id="org34883fc" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 6: </span>Picture of running a server</p>
</div>

<p>
Of course, now you can't see the delay. That's because this server is our hypothetical
one. It doesn't work. If it is a normal working server you should see something like this:
</p>

<div id="org228547a" class="figure">

<p>
If you see a delay like above picture, it means that you have crossed the firewall and now
you can reach anywhere in the world. You can now visit <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>. Have

<p>
Due to iOS software management, it is not easy for iOS devices to bypass. For some reason,
the APP store of iOS is always off-platform for the client that used for bypassing. The
"shadowrocket", which was previously available in the APP stores China area, has now been
removed. As of the completion of this tutorial, the alternative that can be downloaded and
used in China is "shadowbroken". Search and download "shadowbroken" in the APP
store. After downloading and running as shown:
</p>


<div id="orgd4f9398" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/ios1.jpg" alt="ios1.jpg" width="250px">
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 8: </span>Initial running of "shadowbroken"</p>

</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgcf5d7a1"></a>Configure<br>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgcf5d7a1">
<p>
Configuration is similar to Andorid client. Click the "+" button in the picture above. As
picture shows:
</p>

<div id="org9591efa" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/ios3.jpg" alt="ios3.jpg" width="250px">
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 9: </span>After click "+" button</p>
</div>

<p>
Configure it according to the server parameters assumed <a href="#org335a1fa">here</a>. Similar to the Android
client.
</p>

<p>
The most critical difficulty in bypassing of the iOS device is the acquisition of the
client. According to my estimation, it will not be long before "shadowbroken" will be
removed. If that happens, you can try the following solution.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try searching for software that starts with "shadow" in the Chinese region. Perhaps the
ios client has another name on the line.</li>

<li>Try switching your APP store area to a non-China area. What is more difficult to solve
in the switching process is the debit bank card. Students generally do not have a debit
bank card. At this time, we must go to the universal Taobao for searching visa card. Or
try signing up for a paypal account.</li>

<li>Last but not least, for a real Android phone, such as a Google phone.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Thanks to Jabberwocky's help, he provided screenshots of the iOS device to me. :)

may encounter problems with the version of the .Net framework being too low. At this time,
the Windows system will prompt you to upgrade, you only need to follow the prompt to
upgrade. The interface after starting the running is shown below.

<p>
The last step is to run the agent:
</p>
<pre class="example">
